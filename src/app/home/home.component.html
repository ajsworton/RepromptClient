            {{currentUser?.firstName}}, welcome to Reprompt, the examination focused e-learning system. 
            As an educator, Reprompt will allow you to manage your personal cohorts, develop and organise learning and 
            related assessment content and manage publication of aggregate packages to your students so that they are exposed 
            to the material at intervals designed to maximise their retention.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is important to consider a few guidelines when producing material for delivery through reprompt.
        </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Students can only view content that has been published to a cohort they are a member of, with an examination date in the future.</li>
              <li>You can create your own cohorts by assigning users in the system to a group.</li>    
              <li>Content packages are organised in a directory format, and consist of any number of mini-topics with their associated assessment content</li>
              <li>Keep mini-topics short, and organise them under topic folders. This allows better targeted presentation of material that requires exposure.</li>
              <li>Don't forget to produce assessment content for the mini-topics you create, this is a core principle of reprompt's learning system.</li> 
          </ul>

        {{currentUser?.firstName}}, welcome to Reprompt, the examination focused e-learning system. 
        As a student, Reprompt will allow you to prepare for upcoming examinations by initially studying
        content prepared by your educators, and then testing you on the material at intervals designed to maximise your
        retention for the upcoming examination.            
    </p>

    <p>
      When you first encounter content, you will be learning the material in study mode. Content is broken up into small mini-topics which you should actively
      attempt to learn. You will be repeatedly tested on this content at spaced intervals until your examination date.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to get the most out of reprompt, it is important to take the time to study and take the assessments as soon after notification as you can.
      This will help ensure that your grasp of the content is otherwise effortlessly available to you on the date of your examinations.
      Good luck for your upcoming exams! All the best, from the reprompt team.
